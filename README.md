# COVID_19_India_EDA

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered corona-virus. This is currently top priority issue in which huge number of people are trying for its solution in one or other way. I thoughts I will also use my data science knowledge to analyze this data and get some insights. This can be further extended as per the interest. 
Today, we are going to analyse the dataset of COVID-19 India using pandas to find some interesting facts.
Repository contains following files:

1. covid_19_India.csv (Data of state wise COVID cases)

2. AgeGroupDetails.csv (Age group wise percentage data)

3. HospitalBedIndia.csv (Data of available beds across India)

4. IndividualDetails.csv (Data of Individual patients who are recovered and hospitalized)

5. Jupyter Notebook for analysis

Here, The analysis is done to get few of the following interesting questions

1.Get the date and state when we got highest number of patients and deaths.

2.Get State wise death count till date and calculate percentage contribution of each state. Visualise top 10 states based on death counts.

3.Observe the trend of death counts for last 30 days

4.Observe the trend of cured rate for last 30 days

5.Visualise age wise percentage of COVID infections

6.Plot and Visualise total available beds data per state

7.Get the highest count of hospitalisation city wise.

8.Find top 20 cities having hospitalisations till date

Results: 

From the observations, it can be seen that corona patient number is increasing day by day but recovery rate is also increasing. Maharashtra is having highest number of patiets as per data and Tamilnadu has highest number of bed arrangements.

Ackknowledgement: I would like to thank Sudalai Rajkumar for providing the dataset on Kaggle.
